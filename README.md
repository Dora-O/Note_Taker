# Note_Taker
Modified starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. 

This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

Built the back end and connected it to the starter code (front end).

User will be able to write and save notes.

Saved notes will appear on left-hand side and user will be able to click on title of note to open.

User can also delete any saved notes.

User can click on the 'write icon' (looks like a pen/pencil) and will get an empty field to enter a new note title and note text.

This application used starter code containing HTML, CSS, JS file along with the necessary db.json, package.json files and node modules. 

This application uses a server.js file to connect the back end to the front end.
